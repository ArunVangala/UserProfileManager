These are the AddUser.aspx and its code-behind file AddUser.aspx.cs. They contain only the HTML, JavaScript, AJAX methods, and WebMethods implemented in C#.
The database connections (connection strings and related .cs files) are not included for security reasons. You should provide your own connection string.
The project includes a SQLCmds class that handles all ADO.NET connections (SQL connections, commands, etc.) and related methods.
Since the connections are sensitive, they are not published. This project is meant for developers to use their own database setup.
The purpose of this code is to add users based on roles and designations, and it is intended for .NET developers who want a template for user management functionality.
